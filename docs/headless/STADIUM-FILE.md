# HaxBall Stadium File (.hbs)

A HaxBall stadium file is a text file with json5 format which contains a single StadiumObject.

## StadiumObject

StadiumObjects are the root object of a stadium file.

### `name : string`

The name of the stadium.

### `width: float`

The width of a rectangle centered in coordinates <0,0> in which the camera will be contained. The camera follows the player and ball until it reaches the bounds of this rectanngle.

### `height: float`

The height of a rectangle centered in coordinates <0,0> in which the camera will be contained. The camera follows the player and ball until it reaches the bounds of this rectanngle.

### `maxViewWidth : float`

The maximum allowed width viewable width for the level. If the player screen were wide enough for him to see more width than maxViewWidth then the the game will zoom in to prevent that.

Setting maxViewWidth to 0 disables this feature.

Default value: 0

### `cameraFollow : string`

Changes the camera following behaviour.

If set to "player" the camera will follow the player only, ignoring the ball.

If set to "ball" the camera will follow the average position between the player and the ball, the camera will prioritize the player in case player and ball are too far apart.

Default value: "ball"

### `spawnDistance : float`

The distance from <0,0> at which the teams will spawn during kickoff. This value is ignored if `redSpawnPoints` or `blueSpawnPoints` are not empty.

### `canBeStored : Boolean`

This value defines whether this stadium can be stored with the /store command.

Default value: true

### `kickOffReset : String`

Can be set to either `"full"` or `"partial"`.

When set to `"partial"` only the ball and player discs are reset for the kickoff.

When set to `"full"` all discs will be reset for the kickoff.

Default value: `"partial"`

### `bg : BackgroundObject`

An object describing the background for the stadium.

### `traits : Map<string, TraitValues>`

A map of named traits. TraitValues is an object that will define the default values of any object that references that trait with it's "trait" property.

This is useful when manually writing a stadium file to avoid repeating yourself.

The traits applied while loading the stadium and are not preserved internally, it does not make the stadium data smaller over the network for example.

Example:

```json
"traits" : {
  "ballArea" : { "vis" : false, "bCoef" : 1, "cMask" : ["ball"] },
  "goalPost" : { "radius" : 8, "invMass" : 0, "bCoef" : 0.5 },
  "goalNet" : { "vis" : true, "bCoef" : 0.1, "cMask" : ["ball"] },
  "kickOffBarrier" : { "vis" : false, "bCoef" : 0.1, "cGroup" : ["redKO", "blueKO"], "cMask" : ["red", "blue"] },
}
```

It can then be referenced by other objects by using the "trait" property.

```json5
"segments" : [
  { "v0" : 0, "v1" : 1, "trait" : "ballArea" },
  { "v0" : 2, "v1" : 3, "trait" : "ballArea" },
  { "v0" : 4, "v1" : 5, "trait" : "ballArea" },
  { "v0" : 6, "v1" : 7, "trait" : "ballArea" },
  // ...
]
```

### `vertexes : Vertex[]`

List of vertexes.

### `segments : Segment[]`

List of segments.

### `goals : Goal[]`

List of goals.

### `discs : Disc[]`

List of discs.

### `planes : Plane[]`

List of planes.

### `joints : Joint[]`

List of joints.

### `redSpawnPoints : float[][]`

List of spawn points used for the red team kickoff.

If the list is empty then the default spawn behaviour is employed.

When a player is moved into a team after a game has started he will be positioned in the last point in this list. (Unless the list is empty in which case the old spawn behaviour is employed)

Example: `"redSpawnPoints" : [[100, 0], [100, 30], [100, -30], [100, 60], [100, -60], [130,0]]`

Default value: `[]`

### `blueSpawnPoints : float[][]`

Same as `redSpawnPoints` but for the blue team.

### `playerPhysics : PlayerPhysics`

Object describing the player physics.

If omitted player default player physics will be used.

### `ballPhysics : Disc`

The Disc used to create the ball. The collision flags "kick" and "score" will be automatically added.

Setting ballPhysics to the string "disc0" will instead use the first disc as the ball. In this case the cGroup will be left unmodified.

If omitted default ball physics will be used.

---

The type of background to use for the stadium. Possible values are "grass", "hockey", and "none".

Default value: "none"

### `width : float`

The x position for the vertex.

### `y : float`

The y position for the vertex.

### `bCoef : float`

The bouncing coefficient.

[Read more about collision flags here](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Collision-Flags).

### `cGroup : string[]`

A list of flags that represent this object's collision group.

[Read more about collision flags here](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Collision-Flags).

### `trait : string`

---

## Segment

A segment is a line (curved or straight) that connects two vertexes. Discs can collide with segments and they can also be used as decoration.

### `v0 : int`

Index of a vertex in the stadium vertex list to be used as first point of the segment.

### `v1 : int`

Index of a vertex in the stadium vertex list to be used as the second point of the segment.

### `bCoef : float`

The bouncing coefficient.

### `curve : float`

The angle in degrees with which the segment will curve forming an arc between it's two vertexes.

Default value is 0 which makes the segment a straight line.

### `curveF : float`

Alternative representation of the segment's curve. If this value is present the `curve` value will be ignored.

This value is only useful for exporting stadiums without precision loss, it is recommended to remove `curveF` and use only `curve` when editing an exported stadium.

### `bias : float`

If set to 0 the segment will collide normally on both sides.

If greater or lower than 0 the bias determines the thickness of the segment. The segment also becomes a one-way segment that collides only in one of it's sides.

This property can be useful to create boundaries that small and fast moving balls are unable to pass through.

Default value: 0

"color": "transparent" // Make color invisible / transparent

"color": "FF0000" // Make color red

"color": [0,200,0] // Make color green.
```
