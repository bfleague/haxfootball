/**
 * @file Stadium type definitions for HaxBall custom stadiums
 *
 * This module provides TypeScript type definitions for creating valid custom stadiums
 * based on the HaxBall stadium file (.hbs) format specification.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Headless-Host#stadium-file-hbs}
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { StadiumObject } from '@types/stadium';
 * import JSON5 from 'json5';
 *
 * const myStadium: StadiumObject = {
 *   name: "My Custom Stadium",
 *   width: 600,
 *   height: 270,
 *   bg: {
 *     type: "grass",
 *     width: 550,
 *     height: 240
 *   },
 *   vertexes: [
 *     { x: -550, y: -240 },
 *     { x: 550, y: -240 },
 *     // ... more vertices
 *   ],
 *   segments: [
 *     { v0: 0, v1: 1, vis: true, color: "FFFFFF" },
 *     // ... more segments
 *   ],
 *   goals: [
 *     { p0: [-550, -80], p1: [-550, 80], team: "red" },
 *     { p0: [550, -80], p1: [550, 80], team: "blue" }
 *   ]
 * };
 *
 * // Convert to JSON5 string and use with the API
 * const stadiumString = JSON5.stringify(myStadium);
 * room.setStadium(stadiumString);
 * ```
